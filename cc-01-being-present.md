Being Present
=============

    Delivered     : yes

There was a time when I was very engaged in life. Much like a soldier engaged in a battle. Only things that mattered to me were goals to be achieved.

At first I didn't bother to think about their origins, so often they were somehow imposed on me. For example I never really wanted to be a lawyer. Nevertheless at the final year of my education I was so fiercely focused on that goal, that I alienated many people who were once close to me.

I won that battle, but found myself bitter, without money nor many friends, in a bad relationship and chasing someone else's dream.

When my good friend died I realized that life is uncertain and possibly much shorter than expected. I decided that I should set my own goals to be chased.

I always liked to create things and enjoyed interaction with computers. Why not become a software developer then? Now I focused on making really good software.

Having no formal education or professional experience in the field I was learning fast. Within a year I wasn't in any relationship at all, with even fewer friends and not only without money, but with significant debts.

I really needed a job. Any job that pays. So I resentfully dusted off my lawyers degree and found my self in a dreadful place called CCCP - that is Court of Consumer and Competition Protection. Precisely in a Division of Prohibited Business to Consumer Contract Terms. Informally it was called "the Microsection". That's because nobody wanted to work there and only three people did: one young judge, his assistant (that would be me) and a secretary.

If my life seemed to me like a disaster at that point, then I shall say I was a good fit for the job. There were more then 30 new cases filed each day, and obviously we couldn't process them on time.

Most of the cases were very similar, but each required it's own reasoning in writing. After spending months analyzing them we came to a conclusion that correct reasoning for every case could be determined by twelve aspects. That's not many for a lawsuit. But in total there were about 17 millions possible reasonings. That is way too many for a person (even a lawyer) to memorize. But it's quite OK for a computer.

We had computers, but there was no software suitable for the task or any developers at the court. So it seemed to me like another disaster. Or maybe an opportunity?

It took me surprisingly long time to realize it. First I had to become present in my life instead of my dreams. But at last I created very simple application that provided with twelve variables could suggest reasoning for most of the cases.

I was lucky. Because the scale of the disaster, decision makers were very open minded. I had a chance to field test my prototype and it was successful. We began to use it every day.

Gradually my coworkers started to ask me to tweak some aspects of this application or enhance it with new functionality. Soon I was so involved in software development, that the president of the court agreed that it should be my only job.

Suddenly I became passionate about it. The problems were fascinating and I had great freedom in devising solutions. My work was valued by coworkers and together, within a year we managed to process all cases - old and new ones. it was a great success for entire court. And when I decided that it's time to seek new experiences I had no problem finding next job as a software developer.

I think the most important lesson learned during those years is that I should think about my goals every day - but only for a while. Most of the time I should focus on where I am - be present here and now.
