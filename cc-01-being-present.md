Being Present
-------------

I used to be engaged in life. Like a soldier engaged in battle. The only thing that mattered to me was achieving goals.

At first I didn't bother to ask where does the goals come from, so often they were somehow imposed on me. For example I never really wanted to be a lawyer. Nevertheless at my final year at the university I was so fiercely focused on becoming an attorney trainee that I alienated most of my friends and devastated relations with clients.

I did succeed, but within a year I was so bitter that everything seemed like a disappointment. I was in a bad relationship, without many friends nor money, chasing somebody else's dreams.

Some time after one of my good friends - with whom I had very little contact by then - died, I decided that I should chase my own dreams instead. I always liked to create things and enjoyed computers, so I realized I should be a software developer. Now I focused on making really good software.

Having no formal education nor professional experience I was learning a lot in a fast manner. There's a famous rule called *90-90 division*. It states that in software development it takes first 90% of allocated time and resources to implement first 90% of a project. To implement the other 90% of a project it takes the other 90% of resources. I didn't appreciate this rule enough by then.

Another thing I learned is that when you run your own business, it is only part of the equation to have good product or service. You also have to market it and manage your resources.

So, after a year or so I wasn't in any relationship at all, with fewer friends than before and not only without money, but with significant debts.

I really needed a job. Any job. So unwillingly I dusted off my lawyer's degree only to end up in a dreadful place called CCCP - that is Court of Consumers and Competition Protection. Precisely the Section of Prohibited Business to Consumer Contract Terms. By the time I've arrived there it was already informally called "the Microsection". That's because nobody wanted to work there, and only three misfortunate souls did: one judge, his assistant (that's your humble narrator) and a secretary.

If my life seemed like a disaster to me then I shall say I was a good fit for the job. Here disaster was real *modus operandi*. In a first year we worked there there was 3 000 new cases and many more old ones (some more than four years old). Obviously we couldn't manage to process them, so next year another three people were assigned to our team. But the same year we received 7 000 new cases - that's about 35 per working day.

All the cases were very similar, but each required it's own reasoning. After spending months analyzing dozen of them a day, we realized that there were 12 aspects in each, and each aspect had from 2 to 6 variations. That gave roughly 16 777 216 possible reasonings.

That's a little too much for a person (even a lawyer) to memorize, but it's quite ok for computer. We had computers, but there was no suitable software. Further more, there were no developers in the court. Another disaster - software so in need and not being available.

Disaster? Or maybe an opportunity? It took me surprisingly long to realize that. Probably I had to start being present in my life instead of my goals. But secretly and against conventional wisdom of the bureaucracy I created a very simple app, that provided with 12 variables would suggest a reasoning for most of the cases.

Luckily we were all very open minded. Maybe to some extent it was because of the scale of the disaster. I had a chance to field test my prototype and it was a success. Now processing one case only took an few hour instead of days. With this simple automation and my boss's organizational skills, we could further enhance our procedures by sorting and batch processing cases. It was like Henry Ford's factory, only instead of cars we were making court rulings.

Gradually my coworkers and even people from other departments started to ask me to tweak some parts of the app, enhance it with new functionality or to devise new solutions. Soon I was so involved in software development, that the president of the court agreed that it should be my only job.

I became a sole software developer and to my knowledge the only person at the court passionate about his or her job. The problems were fascinating. I had complete freedom in devising the solutions, and people I was working with valued my work. Together we have managed to process not only 14 000 cases that fell on us previous year, but also most of the old ones. And when I decided that it's time to seek new experience I had no problem finding next job as a software developer.

Now I try to think about my goals every day, but only for a while. Rest of the day I focus on where I am.
