Seba is a true stage animal. Whether by nature or through ambitious labor he shows no fear.

Have you noticed his entrance? You might have not. It was so smooth and natural. Despite not knowing my ad hoc introduction in advance Seba easily took on where I have left. He just entered and cheered us up with a small-talk style intro with some interesting facts about the fear of public speaking. It was possible because he prepared the stage ahead. The projector and presentation software was ready and he did not have to attend to it.

Another interesting feature of his speech was audible bridge from the informal introduction to the main part. It was like a bell ringing to remind us that a speech is being delivered and calling all to focus.

The main part started with an outline of the speech enhanced with slides. Unfortunately this time passage from the outline to the body was not as clear to me. It got especially blurred when the speaker started to explain why the topic  is important and deserves a speech. The project book suggests to let the introducer explain the importance of the subject. I haven't done that, and maybe that's why Sebastian felt the need to do it himself. I think this kind of explanation should be generally avoided by speakers, especially in the body of the speech. It should rather be self apparent that the speech is worth to be delivered.

This single issue was quickly forgotten as the speech went on. It was full of information, thoughts and tips relevant for the audience. When the timer displayed a red card my first thought was that either he or I am mistaken as fifteen minutes passed like five to me. Later I have learned that I wasn't alone in this feeling.

Last thing worth mentioning was the conscious body movement of Seba. He is known in our club for taking up entire stage and creating a strong impression of omnipresence - it's one of his trademarks. This time his movement had to be constrained for the slides to be visible. I believe he did a very good job here.

Overall it was a very sound performance - one we could have expected from Seba. As usually we could have learned something not only from the content of his speech, but from the way he delivered it.
