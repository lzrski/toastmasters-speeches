Speech outline
--------------

1. Opening `30-40 sec`

  * A mirror test

    Elephants can recognize themselves in a mirror. However, majority of other animals cannot. Genetics play a vital role in defining gifts and skills of animals. Humans, though, have a shortcut to getting almost any skill much easier than one can imagine. I will show that i) non-stop learning is what makes us humans; ii) difficulty of learning is a fruit of your imagination and iii) you can use your imagination to learn things easier.

2. Body `4 min`

  * Humans have to learn non stop to be humans. Adults who were isolated from society have hard time learning to use a mirror. Learning is easy when you are a child, and become more difficult when you become older.

  * Your imagination is your worst enemy when it comes to learning. Everything is hard until we learn how to do it. However, The things we consider trivial now, were hard for us before we mastered it.

  * Everything is hard until we learn howere hard for us before we mastered it.

3. Conclusion `30 sec - 1 min`

  * Whenever you feel that something you are about to learn is hard - remember it is all your imagination; imagine yourself in the future, when you know how to do it. Then it will be simple.

  * I would add a quote at the very end. Might be reference to an elephant in conclusion to refer to the beginning and close the loop of structure.
